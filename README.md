# JavaSoft

Two applets written for JavaSoft in the 1990s. JavaSoft was a division of Sun Microsystems responsible for Java. Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010.

## JavaSoftMenu
An applet for the JavaSoft online store that was written when JavaSoft (and Sun) were still around and Java-related goods were being sold online (and bought, apparently).

The code is quite old so it could stand to be refactored, but I don't have the interest. This is just to show an old applet project. I've included the necessary images bg2.jpg and pics.jpg as well as an index.html with the applet parameters if you want to try to run it.

## JavaOneAds
An applet for the Java One conference in the 1990s. It was written when JavaSoft (and Sun) were still around.

The code is quite old so it could stand to be refactored and commented. I've included the necessary image images.jpg and an index.html with the applet parameters if you want to try to run it. Note that the companies which no longer have web sites (Netscape and Silicon Graphics) point to my site.
