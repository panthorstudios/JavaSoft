# JSMenu
An applet for the JavaSoft online store that was written when JavaSoft (and Sun) were still around and Java-related goods were being sold online (and bought, apparently).

The code is quite old so it could stand to be refactored, but I don't have the time. This is just to show an old applet project. I've included the necessary images bg2.jpg and pics.jpg as well as an index.html with the applet parameters if you want to try to run it.
